# AGMG GIMI-Mods-Model


-------------------- 

Feel free to used but require needed [3DMIGOTO](https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer)

If I share someone's project, it was with permission and will give credits if they want or not

Personally, I've been playing mods on main server for over month now (at the time of writing this)  
(I know people who've been modding on main for weeks or months and nothing has ever happened)  
so I guess it's safe, but we never know what anime game company may do eventually  
use them on a private server if you really care that much about your account

but to be honest, getting banned is just gonna make you finally quit this gacha hell, win win either way

Join the Discord for more mods, help or just chatting https://discord.gg/agmg 

I may update my mods at any time w/o notice, just some slight improvement really, nothing much
